# First Impressions of Eleventy

I've build static websites using various Static Site Generators and I've found a lot
to like with all of the ones I've used. But, there have been some things that haven't
totally satisfied me and so I decide to take a look at Eleventy. Also, I had been
thinking about creating a blog and there was a project requirement for me to get 
familiar with Azure. So, there seemed to be an alignment of several goals. And, what
better subject for the first blog post than the process of creating the blog itself.
I won't deal with my Azure experiences but there might be another post about that.
